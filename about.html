        <br><br>
        My name is Alice Stricker, I m 18 years old and I'm finishing my lst year of vocational degree in Interactive
        media designer in Switzerland at Eracom. My objetives for the next year is to do internships in differents
        countrys as a sound engineer. I would like to learn all the differents sides of this job from the music
        recording to sound design for cinema.
        <br><br>
        What particularly fascinates me in this field is the power of sound in audiovisual. In my opinion, sound is even
        more crucial than image. It has the unique ability to physically affect the viewer, hurt or relax them through
        certain frequencies, and also has strong emotional power. A soundtrack without images opens the viewer's
        imagination and allows them to escape. It is this experience that I want to live and master, in order to be able
        to create my own impactful projects in the future.
