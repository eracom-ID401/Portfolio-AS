        For my final year project, I wanted to make a short film entirely by myself for the very first time. The theme
        I chose for this film is trauma. This short film illustrates the fact that our traumas follow us everywhere and
        all the time. I wanted to focus on the sound effects during the dance sequences to experiment in this
        area.<br><br>

        I worked with a contemporary dancer from the Swiss school 'La Manufacture'. The presence of contemporary dance
        in my project allowed me to discover this art form and to experiment with sound design on it.<br><br>

        This is an extract of the shortfilm<br><br>

        Pitch:
        A girl is at a party with her friends, but suddenly her anxieties manifest and her past traumas resurface. She
        then throws herself into an internal struggle against her demons, only to realize that they will always be by
        her side.
